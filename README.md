# Tic Tac Toe Game

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid.
The goal is to get three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
This web-based version allows two players to play against each other on the same screen.


## Game Rules
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Player 1 uses "X" and Player 2 uses "O".
- Players take turns marking a square.
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.
- If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.


## How to Play
- Open the index.html file in your browser.
- Player 1 (O) goes first by clicking on any available square.
- Player 2 (X) takes the next turn by clicking an empty square.
- Continue playing until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
- Click the "Restart" button to play again.
